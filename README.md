# async js intro 

Alright, let's break down promises and asynchronous programming in JavaScript in a simple way!

Imagine you're baking a cake with your friend. Your friend says, "I'll go get the eggs, but it might take me a while." Now, you have two options:

You can sit and wait until your friend comes back with the eggs.
You can continue doing other things like preparing the flour, sugar, and butter, and when your friend returns, you can finish making the cake together.
Now, let's relate this to programming:

In JavaScript, when you're doing something that might take some time, like fetching data from a server or reading a file, you have two choices:

You can wait for the task to finish before moving on to the next thing. This is called synchronous programming.
You can keep doing other tasks while waiting for the first one to finish. This is called asynchronous programming.
Promises are like a way of saying, "I promise to do something, and when I'm done, I'll let you know."

Let's see some simple code examples:
##Synchronous Example:

```js
// Synchronous
function bakeCake() {
  let eggs = getEggs();
  let flour = getFlour();
  let sugar = getSugar();

  // Now you can make the cake
}

// This function gets the eggs synchronously
function getEggs() {
  return 'eggs';
}
// Similarly, getFlour and getSugar functions
```

##Asynchronous Example with Callbacks:


```js
// Asynchronous with Callbacks
function bakeCake(callback) {
  getEggs(function(eggs) {
    getFlour(function(flour) {
      getSugar(function(sugar) {
        // Now you can make the cake
        callback();
      });
    });
  });
}

function getEggs(callback) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    callback('eggs');
  }, 2000); // Simulating a delay of 2 seconds
}
// Similarly, getFlour and getSugar functions
```
In the asynchronous example, we're using callbacks. It's like saying, "Hey, go get the eggs, and when you're done, let me know, and while you're getting the eggs, I'll go get the flour."

##Asynchronous Example with Promises:
```js
// Asynchronous with Promises
function bakeCake() {
  getEggs()
    .then(function(eggs) {
      return getFlour();
    })
    .then(function(flour) {
      return getSugar();
    })
    .then(function(sugar) {
      // Now you can make the cake
    });
}

function getEggs() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve('eggs');
    }, 2000); // Simulating a delay of 2 seconds
  });
}
// Similarly, getFlour and getSugar functions
```
In the promises example, it's like saying, "I promise to get the eggs, and when I'm done, I'll let you know. And when you get the eggs, then I promise to get the flour, and so on..."

So, promises are a cleaner and more organized way of handling asynchronous tasks compared to callbacks.

I hope this helps you understand promises and asynchronous programming in JavaScript!
